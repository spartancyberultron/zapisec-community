## 💡 About Zapisec

**ZAPISEC** is purpose-built to secure web applications, APIs, and DNS infrastructure against today’s most sophisticated threats. From the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities to malicious bot traffic, volumetric DDoS attacks, and AI-detected anomalies, ZAPISEC consolidates advanced security capabilities into a single, intuitive platform.

**🔥 Key Security Modules:**

**Application Firewall:**
Defend against injection attacks, XSS, and zero-day exploits with a customizable WAF that enforces strict rulesets and behavior-based anomaly detection.

**Bot Protection:**
Identify and control both good and bad bots using advanced fingerprinting, behavioral analysis, and dynamic bot score-based actions. Allow search engine crawlers while blocking credential stuffers, scrapers, and automation scripts.

**DDoS Management:**
Mitigate Layer 3, 4, and 7 distributed denial-of-service attacks with real-time traffic analysis, rate limiting, IP reputation intelligence, and geo-fencing.

**Anomaly Detection:**
Leverage AI-powered detection engines to identify unusual patterns, suspicious API usage, or traffic behavior anomalies—ensuring proactive threat mitigation.

🧩 Control & Visibility

ZAPISEC gives your security team granular control over:

Firewall rule customization via intuitive rule builders

Real-time traffic visualization and spike alerts

Rate limiting, geo-blocking, and session control

API and DNS protection with protocol-aware defenses

With a central dashboard that integrates all features, ZAPISEC simplifies the management of complex security workflows—making enterprise-grade protection accessible and manageable.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🔥 Application Firewall (WAF)
- **Custom Rules**: Define and deploy domain-specific security rules using various attributes (IP, country, path, method, etc.).
- **Managed Rules**: Predefined set of 48 WAF rules to block common attack vectors, with an option to extend and tailor to your needs.
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttle incoming requests based on thresholds to mitigate brute-force, scraping, or abuse attempts per domain.

### 2. 🤖 Bot Protection
- **Good Bots**: Automatically allows verified bots from search engines (Google, Bing), social networks (X, Facebook), and cloud providers (AWS, Azure).
- **Bad Bots**: Detects and blocks harmful bots like content scrapers, credential stuffers, botnets, and impersonators using behavioral and signature-based techniques.

### 3. 📈 Anomaly Detection
- Real-time detection of traffic anomalies such as request spikes, pattern deviation, and behavioral oddities. The system analyzes root causes and tags anomalies for investigation.

### 4. 🛡️ DDoS Protection
- Defends against L3-L7 DDoS attacks using smart rule logic and filtering.
- Block or challenge requests based on:
  - IP Address or Range
  - Geographic Location (Country)
  - ASN (Autonomous System Number)
  - HTTP Method, Path, Host
  - Headers, Cookies, and User Agent

### 5. 🌐 DNS Management
- DNS configuration, record management, and propagation monitoring all in one panel.
- Seamless integration with firewall rules for unified security management.
