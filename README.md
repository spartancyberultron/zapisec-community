## 💡 About Zapisec

**Zapisec** is engineered to defend web applications, APIs, and DNS systems from OWASP Top 10 threats, malicious bots, volumetric attacks, and zero-day anomalies. It integrates powerful tools into a single dashboard so teams can configure granular firewall rules, detect traffic spikes, manage trusted bots, enforce rate limits, and guard against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

Zapisec empowers you with full control over your application traffic and attack surfaces, using AI-enhanced detection and customizable rule engines.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🔥 Application Firewall (WAF)
- **Custom Rules**: Define and deploy domain-specific security rules using various attributes (IP, country, path, method, etc.).
- **Managed Rules**: Predefined set of 48 WAF rules to block common attack vectors, with an option to extend and tailor to your needs.
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttle incoming requests based on thresholds to mitigate brute-force, scraping, or abuse attempts per domain.

### 2. 🤖 Bot Protection
- **Good Bots**: Automatically allows verified bots from search engines (Google, Bing), social networks (X, Facebook), and cloud providers (AWS, Azure).
- **Bad Bots**: Detects and blocks harmful bots like content scrapers, credential stuffers, botnets, and impersonators using behavioral and signature-based techniques.

### 3. 📈 Anomaly Detection
- Real-time detection of traffic anomalies such as request spikes, pattern deviation, and behavioral oddities. The system analyzes root causes and tags anomalies for investigation.

### 4. 🛡️ DDoS Protection
- Defends against L3-L7 DDoS attacks using smart rule logic and filtering.
- Block or challenge requests based on:
  - IP Address or Range
  - Geographic Location (Country)
  - ASN (Autonomous System Number)
  - HTTP Method, Path, Host
  - Headers, Cookies, and User Agent

### 5. 🌐 DNS Management
- DNS configuration, record management, and propagation monitoring all in one panel.
- Seamless integration with firewall rules for unified security management.
