## üöÄ Key Features

# üåê Application Firewall

The **Application Firewall** is designed to provide robust security for your web applications by filtering, monitoring, and blocking malicious HTTP/S traffic. It comes with an embedded engine of **7,000+ rules**, organized into **customizable**, **managed**, and **rate-limiting** components.

## ‚úÖ Core Components

### üîí 1. Custom Rules
Define and enforce **domain-specific security logic** using:

- **IP-based filtering** (whitelist/blacklist)
- **Country-based access control**
- **URL path matching**
- **HTTP method restrictions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)**
- **Custom headers validation**
- **Regex-based payload inspection**

## ü§ñ Bot Protection

Bot Protection is a critical security layer designed to distinguish between **good bots** (legitimate, helpful bots) and **bad bots** (malicious or abusive agents). This feature uses **behavioral analysis**, **signature-based detection**, **rate-limiting**, and **challenge-based validation** to control automated access.

---

### ‚úÖ Good Bots

These are bots from trusted sources that are automatically allowed based on user-agent verification, IP reputation, and reverse DNS lookups:

| **Social Networks** | Facebook External Hit, Twitterbot, LinkedInBot   | Bots used to generate link previews and rich media embeds for shared URLs. |
| **Cloud Services** | AWS Health Check, Azure Monitor, GCP AppEngine   | Cloud service bots used for uptime monitoring, diagnostics, or syncs.      |

---

### üö´ Bad Bots

Bad bots are blocked or challenged using behavior tracking (mouse movement, keyboard emulation), header validation, IP fingerprinting, and known bot signatures.

| Type                        | Examples / Indicators                                 | Description                                                                 |

| **Security Violators**     | SQLi scanners, XSS payloads, path fuzzers             | Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities through automated requests.             |
| **Content Scrapers**       | HTTrack, Scrapy, Python-urllib, curl, wget            | Try to copy entire site content or competitive intelligence.               |
| **Bot Emulating Humans**   | Headless Chrome, Puppeteer, Selenium, PhantomJS       | Mimic user behavior using automation to bypass detection.                  |
| **Social Networks (Fake)** | Fake engagement bots on X, Instagram, or Reddit       | Post spam, inflate engagement, or distribute misinformation.               |
| **Suspicious Behavior**    | Irregular intervals, rapid clicks, non-human patterns | Fails browser challenges or exhibits erratic navigational paths.           |
| **Cloud Services (Abuse)** | Abuse from proxy networks like AWS, GCP, Azure        | Used to mask botnet origins or launch attacks at scale.                    |
| **Human Routing Channels** | Residential proxy, mobile proxy, P2P botnets          | Bots routed via real users or infected devices to bypass IP blocks.        |


By deploying Bot Protection, you safeguard your application against **automated abuse**, **credential stuffing**, **data theft**, and **fake traffic**, while ensuring uninterrupted access to beneficial bots.
