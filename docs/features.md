# üîê Platform Features Overview

Our platform provides a comprehensive suite of security tools designed to protect web applications and manage DNS with precision and flexibility. Below is a breakdown of all major features currently supported.

---

## üî• 1. Application Firewall

Our Web Application Firewall (WAF) is highly customizable and domain-specific.

### a. Custom Rules
Users can define custom rules tailored to their specific application behavior.

- Apply rules per domain
- Define match criteria using fields like:
  - IP, Country, ASN
  - HTTP Method, Path, Host
  - User-Agent, Cookies, Headers
- Rule actions: Allow, Block, Challenge, Log

### b. Managed Rules
The platform offers a set of 48 pre-defined WAF rules covering common attack vectors, including:

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Remote Code Execution
- Path Traversal
- Common CVEs

> Users can also extend this set by adding custom managed rules.

### c. Rate Limiting
Control abusive behavior and traffic flooding:

- Limit requests per second, minute, or hour
- Scope rules per IP or Path
- Burst handling
- Domain-specific configuration
- Useful for protecting login pages, APIs, etc.

## ü§ñ 2. Bot Protection

Automatically detect and respond to both beneficial and malicious bots.

### Good Bots (Allowed)
- Search Engines: Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Baidu, Yandex
- Social Networks: Facebook, X (Twitter)
- Cloud Services: AWS, GCP, Azure
- Verified Human Browsers

### Bad Bots (Blocked or Challenged)
- Security Violators
- Content Scrapers
- Bots Emulating Humans
- Bots Showing Suspicious Behavior Patterns

> Each bot is classified using user-agent patterns and behavior profiling.

## üìà 3. Anomaly Detection

Real-time detection and flagging of suspicious behavior and traffic spikes.

- Monitors traffic per domain and region
- Detects anomalies in request rates, payload patterns, and session behavior
- Automatically applies mitigation actions (e.g., rate limiting or challenge)
- Anomaly classification: Spike Detection, Behavioral Deviance, Unusual Path Access

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 4. DDoS Protection

Robust DDoS mitigation engine with configurable rules.

- Filter or block based on:
  - IP / IP Range
  - Country / ASN
  - HTTP Method, Path, Host
  - User-Agent, Cookie, Header
- Real-time threat intelligence applied across all domains
- Automated detection of large-scale coordinated attacks
- Challenge, rate-limit, or block malicious requests

---

## üåê 5. DNS Management

Simplified domain and DNS configuration for protected assets.

- A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, MX, NS records
- Custom DNS zones per domain
- Instant propagation and zone editing
- DNS-level protection for origin concealment and security hardening

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Coming Soon

- Webhooks for alerts and anomaly events
- API for rule automation
- Threat intelligence dashboard
- AI-driven rule recommendations
